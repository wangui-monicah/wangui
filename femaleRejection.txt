On Rejection, and the Fear of Becoming a Woman Who Waited Too Long

I somewhat got rejected yesterday by exxxx. 
And today, I find myself thinking about mxxxxxx: 
not even with longing, but with heaviness.

There’s this idea people always say: 
that older people have burdens.
And when I was younger, 
I used to think that this baggage came from big things: 
failed love, broken marriages, addictions, catastrophic decisions.

But now I see it’s quieter than that.
Sometimes it’s something as small and mundane as this.
A rejection. A slow vanishing. A memory that won’t sit down.

That’s what builds into a burden.

And I don’t want to carry that.
I don’t want to carry the scars that people have tried to mark me with: 
even when they don’t leave bruises.
I want to protect my soul. 
Protect my skin. 
Protect my mind.
Protect me.

Because I wonder: sometimes, 
whether people come into your life intending to hurt you.
Or maybe not with the intention to wound, 
but with a complete lack of care for whether they do.

And I wonder why.
What do you get from it?

Because at the end of the day, 
don’t we all die?
Don’t we all vanish? 
So what is the purpose of stepping into someone’s spirit just to rot something?

I admit I’m not perfect.
Maybe I’ve hurt people too.
But I don’t think I’ve ever stepped into someone’s life with the goal of harm.
Hurt might happen. But it’s never been the point.

That’s when I start to get scared.
Scared of people.
Scared of what they’re capable of when they’re careless with someone soft.

His rejection hurt.
Not because I wanted him forever: 
I didn’t.
But because I hoped that maybe someone who once wanted me would still hold space for my humanness.

He didn’t.
And it made me feel like I should’ve never reached out. 
Like maybe my openness was a mistake.

I know that his rejection is not a reflection of my worth.
But why does the uneasiness still linger?

How do I not make other people’s inability to love me a statement about who I am?

How do I keep loving myself even when others don’t?
How do I keep being open, when it seems like people only love me when they don’t know me?

Because that’s what I’m learning: People want me at a distance.
Not physical distance, emotional distance.

They love me when I’m untouchable, unbothered, unavailable.
They want the dream.
They want the version of me that floats,
The version untouched but seen.
The version unreal

But when I bring them into the real,
when I speak honestly, 
when I ask for care, 
when I show my soft self
they leave.

And so I’m starting to feel like maybe I need an alter ego.
My own version of Ava Gardner.

Someone beautiful. Someone untouchable.
Someone the public obsesses over, but never really knows.

Because maybe that’s the only safe way to be loved.
Maybe the lesson is that closeness is a trap.
That love is safest when it’s just out of reach.

But even Ava wasn’t safe.
She tried to love.
She gave herself to men who couldn’t hold her.
She chased the idea of love.
And in the end, 
even her myth couldn’t save her.

That terrifies me.
Because what if I become her?
What if I spend my life chasing the idea of a man I’ll never meet?

What if that man doesn’t even exist?

What if no one can ever meet me the way I want to be met?

That possibility,
that I might have to build a life where romantic love is absent,
feels both terrifying and weirdly comforting.

Because men
in my observations, 
in Ava’s experience, 
can be draining.

And I’m tired.

I don’t want to get even.
I don’t want to close up in bitterness.
But to let go of the need for love.
Not in a numb way. 
In a liberating way.

To erase men from the blueprint.
To stop writing love into the margins of my every chapter.
To build something
anything 
that exists without needing to be chosen.

To live not like a woman waiting for love, 
but like a woman who was always enough without it.
