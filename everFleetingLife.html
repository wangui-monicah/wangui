<h1>The Trial of Freedom</h1>

<p>One of the harshest truths is how fleeting the present is: how permanent time remains, even as it slips through our fingers. We live whole lives, and yet the mind can only bold fragments. You look back, and realize you spent years doing everything, and remember almost nothing.</p>

<p>Lately, I've been finding my way back to God.</p>

<p>He calls me to a higher standard: to a life of dignity, to a heart that refuses to wound others. As a child, I thought I understood this. I lived innocently, untouched by temptation. I used to wonder: why did the Bible speak so insistently about purity, when it seemed so easy?</p>

<p>Now, I understand.</p>

<p>That message was never meant for the innocent: it was meant for those who had tasted the fullness of freedom. For the orphaned, for the grown, for those who step into adulthood and find themselves drunk on liberty.</p>

<p>As a child, you dream of freedom. As an adult, you drown in it. No one stands between you and the abyss. No one pulls you back from your own undoing.</p>

<p>And so Christ's message is hard: terribly hard.</p>

<p>In a world without chains, how does a soul stay pure? In a life where every indulgence is permitted, who guards the gates to the heart?</p>

<p><strong>\"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\"</strong></p>

<p>Oh, how difficult it is to keep the heart pure. Oh, how arduous it is to cleanse a heart thatâ€™s already stained. The soul, the mind, the body, the spirit: how fragile they become when no one demands their keeping but yourself.</p>

<p>And that is the trial of freedom: <strong>WHEN SIN IS AN OPTION: AND SO IS HOLINESS.</strong></p>
